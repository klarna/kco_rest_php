## Logging and Debugging

PHP SDK logs information to STDOUT/STDERR. To enable debug mode, set DEBUG_SDK environment variable:

```
$ DEBUG_SDK=true php <your_program.php>
```

or

```
$ export DEBUG_SDK=1
$ php <your_program.php>
```

Another way to enable Debugging Mode is `define` the **DEBUG_SDK** inside your script:

```php
<?php
// some code here
define('DEBUG_SDK', true);
// some code here
```

The output will look like:

```
DEBUG MODE: Request
