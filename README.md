Klarna Checkout is a revolutionary new payment solution that is changing the way
people shop online. First, consumers verify their purchase with a minimal
amount of information through intelligent identification, securing your order
immediately, and then complete their payment afterwards â€“ separating buying
from paying and dramatically increasing conversion. Klarna Checkout also allows
merchants to offer all payment methods through one supplier, minimizing
administration, costs and integration time.
